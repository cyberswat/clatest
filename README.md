Preview contributor license agreement

We have a desire to enable a Contributor License Agreement across our organization.  This is a fairly standard process and we believe the license agreement to be innocuous and straight forward.

Once this pull request is approved by everyone we will enable this agreement organization wide.  Once the agreement is implemented organization wide this repository will be deleted.

Here are some example CLA agreements from other software projects you can use to compare:

 - Kubernetes https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md
 - React https://code.facebook.com/cla
 - Apache https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas
 - GitHub https://cla.github.com/
 - Golang https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#cla
